    <p> The purpose of the game was to be designed in functions similar to Flappy Bird
        , but the characteristics would be different such as different obejects and obstacles. The scripts
        that were most focused on were the fish as in the character and automobiles and flying objects for the obstacles. The fish 
        had to dodge the objects by moving up and down, but also moving forward if wanted.The two obstacles that I faced were how to input 
        a restart button when the game is over and also how to display an introduction for the instructions.I resolved these problems by 
        assigning the green flag as the restart button and for the introduction I had to use the game's manual by stating when the user
        clicks begin, then the game will start.
